# socialMediaAPI

## Description
In this project, I use an Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose to set up the backend for a social media app. The backend is able to process
creating, updating, and deleting users of the app. Each user has associated friends and thoughts which are like posts. Each user's friends list
and posts can also be added to, updated, and subtracted from. Similarly, each user's posts can also have associated reactions from other users. These reactions
can also be created, deleted, adn updated. Essentially CRUD operations are available for users, thoughts (posts), post reactions from users, and user friend lists.
